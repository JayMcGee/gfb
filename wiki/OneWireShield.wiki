= Introduction =

After dealing with loose dangly wires for so long I finally decided to design an Arduino OneWire Shield. It uses 4 pins, 2 for independent onewire networks, and two additional LEDs on the nice Tyco rj-45 connectors. Additionally I included space for the Dallas 3231 RTC which I sorely miss in most of my Arduino projects.

= Details =

Includes:
 * 2 Independent OneWire RJ-45 ports with activity LED
 * 2 additional LEDs on the RJ-45 socket
 * Battery-backed RTC
 * 4 spots for local OneWire devices (2 on each network)

== Want one? ==
I ordered the boards fabbed through seeedstudio (they are great!) and got the minimum 10 boards which obviously I don't need. Let me know If you need one and I'll send it your way for oh $10? (just the board) Does that sound reasonable? :)
